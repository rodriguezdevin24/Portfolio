        I was born in New York City to two hardworking immigrants from Colombia
        who came to the U.S. seeking a better life for their family. From a
        young age, I valued creativity, health, and fitness. I've always had a
        passion for learning new skills and helping others thrive. My early
        experiences in high school JROTC, where I led a team to 5th place in a
        competition, instilled in me a sense of leadership that would later be
        reinforced during my military service.
