            <p>I graduated from General Assembly's Full Stack Software Engineering Immersive course, where I honed my skills in MERN stack and Python/Django REST. The course was challenging, but it ignited a passion in me for coding and problem-solving. I particularly enjoy working with React and Node, and I have a keen interest in design and animations. During my time at the bootcamp, I collaborated with a UI/UX team to build a full app using Django REST framework, Web3 technologies, and chatbox technologies. I continue to work on projects with this team, and I'm always eager to learn more and grow in this field. In my previous role as a senior medic at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington DC, I was responsible for implementing a falls protocol that significantly improved patient safety. This experience taught me the importance of leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving, skills that I bring to my work as a developer. </p>
