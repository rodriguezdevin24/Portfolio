        <p>
          Hello! I'm a full-stack developer based in New York City with a
          background in healthcare as a medic in the Army. I'm bilingual,
          speaking both English and Spanish, and I'm currently serving in the
          reserves. I've always had a passion for creativity and technology.
          From a young age, I loved building things and exploring the
          capabilities of computers. However, it wasn't until my time in the
          military, where I discovered my love for learning, that I decided to
          pursue a career in tech.
