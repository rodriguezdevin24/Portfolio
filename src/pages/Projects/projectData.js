      "As one of the team leads for IdentityLock, I led the development of this innovative app that revolutionizes digital identity management using blockchain, NFTs, and AI chatbox technologies. I played a key role in creating an overall seamless user experience with React.js, implementing chatbox technology, and crafting engaging animations. On the backend, I contributed to the development of our robust system built with SQL, Python, and Django, and resolved a critical issue with our PostgreSQL table. I also ensured seamless integration between the front-end and back-end. IdentityLock showcases my ability to lead and contribute to a project that combines innovative ideas with complex technologies.",

    description: "Ego Quest is a web-based application I developed about six weeks into my coding journey. The application is designed to make weight loss tracking simple and engaging. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the front-end, and Node.js and Express.js in the backend, Ego Quest provides an intuitive interface for users to monitor their progress. The application also integrates the HTML5 QR Code library, adding a unique, interactive element to the user experience. Despite the early stage of my coding knowledge at the time, I was able to successfully create a functional and user-friendly application. I'm currently working on a new version of Ego Quest, incorporating more advanced technologies I've learned since the initial build, including a functional barcode reader. Stay tuned!",
