      "As one of the team leads for IdentityLock, I led the development of this innovative app that revolutionizes digital identity management using blockchain, NFTs, and AI chatbox technologies. I played a key role in creating an overall seamless user experience with React.js, implementing chatbox technology, and crafting engaging animations. On the backend, I contributed to the development of our robust system built with SQL, Python, and Django, and resolved a critical issue with our PostgreSQL table. I also ensured seamless integration between the front-end and back-end. IdentityLock showcases my ability to lead and contribute to a project that combines innovative ideas with complex technologies.",

      "As the team lead for Dog Friends, I spearheaded the development of a unique social media platform that allows users to create posts from their dog's perspective. This MERN stack application was born out of my love for dogs and a desire to create a more positive social media experience. In this project, I played a significant role in both front-end and back-end development. I led the implementation of JWT authentication and was heavily involved in creating a user-friendly interface. The app allows users to view profiles, create posts, and interact with other users, all in a fun and engaging way. Dog Friends is a testament to my ability to lead a project from conception to completion, learning new technologies along the way. I'm currently planning to continue its development, with the goal of launching it exclusively in NYC in the near future.",

      "This is a web-based application I developed about five weeks into my coding journey. The application is designed to make weight loss tracking simple and engaging. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the front-end, and Node.js and Express.js in the backend, Ego Quest provides an intuitive interface for users to monitor their progress. The application also integrates the HTML5 QR Code library, adding a unique, interactive element to the user experience. Despite the early stage of my coding knowledge at the time, I was able to successfully create a functional and user-friendly application. I'm currently working on a new version of Ego Quest, incorporating more advanced technologies I've learned since the initial build, including a functional barcode reader. Stay tuned!",

      "This is a fun, engaging application I developed just two weeks into my coding journey. The app gamifies everyday tasks, encouraging users to outdo their previous day's performance. Completing tasks earns you points, visualized in a playful basketball game. A winning animation rewards you for surpassing yesterday's score, while a losing animation prompts you to try harder. Built with vanilla JavaScript, the app introduced me to JSON for data management and local storage for persisting tasks and scores. While the data doesn't persist on refresh due to the lack of a server-side, this project was a valuable stepping stone in my coding journey. It was my first exposure to data management and the concept of local storage. I am excited to revisit this concept in the future, leveraging my expanded knowledge to create a more advanced version with a proper server-side. Task Buckets stands as a testament to my early passion for coding and my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.",
